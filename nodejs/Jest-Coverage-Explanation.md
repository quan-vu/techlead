# Jest Coverage Explanation

Jest is a popular JavaScript testing framework commonly used for testing JavaScript and TypeScript applications. One of the features of Jest is code coverage analysis, which provides insight into how much of your codebase is covered by your tests. When you run Jest with code coverage enabled, it will generate a code coverage report, which includes several key metrics and visual representations of your code's test coverage.

Here's an explanation of the main elements you'll find in a Jest code coverage report:

1. **Coverage Percentage**: This is the most prominent metric in a code coverage report. It represents the percentage of your code that is covered by tests. It is often broken down into different categories, including lines, statements, functions, and branches.

   - **Lines**: The percentage of lines of code that are executed during your tests.
   - **Statements**: The percentage of individual statements (lines of code) that are executed.
   - **Functions**: The percentage of functions (JavaScript functions and methods) that are executed.
   - **Branches**: The percentage of conditional branches (if statements, switch cases, etc.) that are executed. This indicates whether both the true and false branches of conditional statements are tested.

2. **Color Coding**: Code coverage reports often use color coding to indicate coverage status. Common colors include:
   - **Green**: Code that is covered by tests.
   - **Red**: Code that is not covered by tests.
   - **Yellow**: Branches within conditional statements that are partially covered.

3. **Coverage Tables**: The report typically includes tables that list specific files in your codebase along with their coverage statistics. Each file is broken down into the coverage percentages for lines, statements, functions, and branches. This helps you identify which parts of your code need more testing.

4. **Source Code Annotations**: In some code coverage reports, you may see source code annotations that indicate which lines or branches were covered and which were not. This is useful for quickly identifying untested code.

5. **Total and Per-File Coverage**: The report will provide both the overall coverage percentage for your entire codebase and individual coverage percentages for each file, allowing you to pinpoint which files may need more testing.

6. **Threshold Configuration**: You can configure Jest to fail a build or test run if coverage falls below a certain threshold. This helps enforce minimum coverage standards in your project.

7. **HTML or LCOV Reports**: Jest can generate code coverage reports in different formats, including HTML and LCOV. The HTML report is often more human-readable and provides an interactive interface for exploring code coverage visually, while the LCOV format is commonly used in continuous integration and code analysis tools.

Jest coverage reports are valuable for assessing the effectiveness of your tests, identifying areas of your codebase that need more attention, and ensuring that your code is well-tested. They help you maintain code quality and catch potential issues before they reach production.

## Example

Example a coverage report for a project.

> 80.21% Statements 1743/217361.32% Branches 314/51254.66% Functions 123/22580.21% Lines 1743/2173

**What does that mean?**

The information you've provided is a code coverage report, and it breaks down the coverage of your codebase in terms of lines, statements, branches, and functions. Here's what each of those numbers means:

1. **Statements**: 80.21%
   - This means that out of a total of 2173 statements (lines of code), 1743 have been executed during your tests. In other words, 80.21% of your code's statements are covered by your tests.

2. **Branches**: 32.32%
   - Out of a total of 512 branches (conditional branches like if statements), 314 have been executed during your tests. This indicates that 32.32% of your code's branches are covered by your tests.

3. **Functions**: 46.66%
   - You have a total of 225 functions in your code, and 123 of them have been executed during your tests. This shows that 46.66% of your code's functions are covered by your tests.

4. **Lines**: 80.21%
   - This is the same as the statement coverage. Out of a total of 2173 lines of code, 1743 have been executed during your tests, resulting in an 80.21% line coverage.

In summary, these numbers represent the percentage of your code that is covered by your tests for different categories (statements, branches, functions, and lines). It's a measure of how thoroughly your tests exercise your codebase. Higher percentages are generally better, indicating better test coverage, while lower percentages suggest areas of your code that may need additional testing to improve overall code quality and reliability.

**I a need report one number for my project in hight level which number I should use?**

When you need to provide a single, high-level metric for your project's code coverage, it's common to use a single percentage value that represents overall test coverage. This percentage often corresponds to statement coverage, as it's a fundamental measure of how many lines of code are executed by your tests. In your provided coverage report, the statement coverage is 80.21%, which means that 80.21% of your code's statements are executed by your tests.

So, if you need to report one number for your project's code coverage, you can use the statement coverage percentage, which is 80.21% in your case. This number gives a high-level overview of how well your project's code is covered by tests, and it's a commonly used metric for assessing overall test coverage.
